Learn new language
----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have been learning languages for a long time and never ask myself: 
- What makes my understanding better
- What is the mechanisms that allows me to learn and compile sentences
- What rules should I follow to learn a new language on the maximum 
speed

The brain is a quite flexible thing, 
so lets look on some known facts about it and try to use them for our 
purpose:

### 1. Use it or loose it

Our brain has two interesting abilities: synaptic prooning and 
synaptic flexibility. The first one optimize synaptic connections,
constantly reorganizing it or removing .The second one is about 
reinforcing the connections or loose it.
    
So to not to loose any acquired knowledge you need to learn and repeat
the information and that will change the structure of your brain,
just think about it for a while. This information will go in your 
long-term memory and will stay there for a long time.

Start to think on the language. If you like to talk to yourself - start
to talk on this language. Dive even deeper wrap yourself into that 
language environment. Watch movies with subtitles, read news,
get some penpale.

> _There is some resources I would recommend:_
> - _netflix.com - lot of movies with audios and subtitles_
> - _ted.com - ted talks in czech with subtitles on czech_
> - _slowczech.com - very simple texts with audio_
> - _mylanguageexchange.com - international penpals for exchange of language_ 
> - _duolingvo.com - simple application to exercise regularly_

Previously I got only duolingvo lessons because that is simple 
and it does not require so much time. Also I got a penpale in Prague.

Even for the first time even if you recognize only 10 % of words 
it is good to hear a speech and try to distinguish the words one 
from another. Some time it would be more like "blvkrky" but train 
for a while and you will know how to split it. But the main point is to
do that regularly.

### 2. Learn sleep repeat

During night our brain systematize all the stuff we got during the day,
so the better approach is to learn something new just before falling 
asleep and then after you wake up next morning try to revoke it in memory.

That is it I got some trigger on it in my mind: if I move to the bed
for sleep I take a list of new words and repeat it 5 times,
then when I got some coffee on breakfast I drink it and try to recall 
the words.

> _There is some resources I would recommend:_
>- _prirucka.ujc.cas.cz - official free dictionary_
>- _quizlet.com - application for making cards_

Before that I used to use some cards but it takes to much time 
to do the paper cards, so I switched to use a list of words that I write 
before falling asleap. I do it not only for words but for grammar as well.

The information could be even senseless but repeating it again and again
force your brain to systemize it somehow. If that is a
grammar paragraph you split it on the themas and simplify it. If that is
a difficult definition you make some logical 
connections change it for conciseness to pack it in your brain.

### 3. Write it

Lets talk a bit about Fusiform gyrus. That is a part of our brain that
is responsible for translation visual stimulus to characters and words.
    
Start to write more on the language. Chat with friends, write some letters,
keep a diary. The more you will write, the more words will be recognized 
by FG. You don't need to write a new "War and Piece", 3 simple 
sentences about how was your day could be enough.
    
> _There is some tips on it:_
>- _Add the language keyboard in your smartphone_
>- _Add another keyboard layout to your laptop_
>- _If you have a Kindle - download a dictionary pack for it_
    
I use to type the words only. I have been chatting for a long time
via telegram and since any modern smartphone nowadays got some
variance of autocomplition it helps a lot to write something
that is still meaningful for another person. 
    
I want to keep a diary and wrote there the 3 achievements of 
the day I made. Since that is not so much I can keep it simple and 
get some ideas of words that I need in my daily life. 
Plus addition articulation that is engaged when ai do so will mark up the 
accuracy and give more attention to grammar I never used before.
        
### 4. Fake it till you make it

Human brain contain some special neurons called mirror neurons. 
By mimicking others, you train it. You absorb the culture 
the gestures, body position and movements. 
That what children do. They are looking on mother's month and
develop they articulation.
 
 Start to watch people on movies or streets, how do they express
 their fillings when the month is busy or if words are not 
 enough to share it. Or listen a radio. That would probably 
 hard to understand the meaning, but you will learn how
 to make a right stress to highlight ideas.
 
 > Tips:
 > - _Go for cinema on czech movie_
 > - _Buy a radio watchs and set an alarm clock on it_
 > - _Try theater there are planty of plays with english subtitles_
 > - _Launch some group of interest. It could be dance, yoga, anything_
    
 Previously I have been bouldering in Flash surrounded
 by czech people. My trainer spoke czech as well. 
 I wake up with "Radio Hey" that is not only starts with a 
 morning news at 8 AM but also plays nice energetic music to make my day.
 
 Currently I enrolled a group for practicing aero silk. It would
 be on czech but trainer told me that it is not a problem. In the future 
 I would like to go for a local mountaineering club to share
  experience and practice different methods.
 
 In summary I would like to highlite the fact that the ability 
 to learn languages is pretty much the same as a blind typing skills.
 Practicing a lot gradually step by step in the beggining
 trying to  decrease amount of mistakes as much as
 possible and keep practicing using the most powerful instrument 
 we ever could get will definitely lead as to systematic accumulation 
 and reinforcement of our language skill.
